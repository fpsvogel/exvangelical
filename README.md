# Exvangelical

Hi there! I was raised in a conservative Christian context. In recent years, in the process of becoming an adult and making sense of the world, I've realized that many of the old answers just don't work. So I'm growing and learning, using this space to save my favorite books and other resources.

## Spiritual practices

After our childhood faith is no more, how can we maintain a healthy spirituality?

- 📕[Mike McHargue - *Finding God in the Waves: How I Lost My Faith and Found It Again Through Science*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28363993). Later in the book Mike explains how, despite the many doubts he still has about God, spiritual practices still enrich his life. Which makes me wonder: if we all approached religion in a more practice-oriented way (not just belief-centric), maybe our dialogue in and out of church would be healthier.

## Biblical interpretation

How did the Bible come to be? How can we read it more skillfully and more fruitfully?

- 📕[Adam Hamilton – *Making Sense of the Bible: Rediscovering the Power of Scripture Today*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20820158). An accessible introduction to reading the Bible in context.
- 📕[Greg Boyd – *Inspired Imperfection: How the Bible's Problems Enhance Its Divine Authority*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/44541760). Argues that the Bible is ugly and shocking for the same reasons that Jesus being crucified was ugly and shocking, and in the end the Bible's warts make it all the more beautiful.

## Science and cosmology

Many Christians think that the truth of the Bible depends on a 6000-year-old Earth, which means denying mainstream science. Science denial is one of the most oft-cited reasons that young people give for leaving the church: a 2011 survey found that 25% of young ex-churchgoers felt that "Christianity is anti-science." And doubtless this same perception keeps many others from ever stepping foot in a church.

- 📕[Aaron Yilmaz – *Deliver Us From Evolution?: A Christian Biologist's In-Depth Look at the Evidence Reveals a Surprising Harmony Between Science and God*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35225618). Written by a former young-earth creationist, it addresses creationist arguments head-on.
  - If you get bogged down in that, another good starting point is 📕[Denis Lamoureux – *I Love Jesus & I Accept Evolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6553824). Or if you prefer a mix of readings and videos, Dr. Lamoureux also made 🌐[a free online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-and-religion-101).
  - You can watch a nice summary in the video 🎞️["What is the evidence for evolution?"](https://youtu.be/lIEoO5KdPvg)
- 📕[Robin Parry – *The Biblical Cosmos: A Pilgrim's Guide to the Weird and Wonderful World of the Bible*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24853751). An investigation of how ancient Israelites viewed the world around them, which (spoiler alert) is very different from how we modern people see the world. The concluding chapters are fascinating, on how we modern people might fruitfully use this ancient view of the world.
- 🎞️[InspiringPhilosophy – videos about evolution and faith](https://inspiringphilosophy.org/evolution-and-genesis). Also his video 🎞️["The Origins of Young Earth Creationism"](https://youtu.be/RLcNTAi0Cw4).
- 📕[John Walton – *The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8609131). If you're wondering how Genesis 1 can possibly fit with a very old universe, here's an exploration of how ancient Israelites understood creation.
- 📄[Greg Boyd – "Evolution as Cosmic Warfare: A Biblical Perspective on Satan and 'Natural' Evil"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Creation_Made_Free/gwpMAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA125). (Most of the article is available on Google Books via that link. Whenever you see that the next page is unavailable, just write the next page number into the URL bar, e.g. "&pg=PA126", and press Enter.) If you're wondering how evolution (a process necessarily involving death) fits with a perfect creator, here is one approach that also offers an alternative theodicy along the way, in which evil does not come from God. It's a great antidote for all those times when you're opening up to someone about something horrible that happened to you and they rattle off the classic reply "God has a plan" or "God is in control". Oh thanks, it's so reassuring to know that God is the evil puppetmaster in my life.

## Gender and sexuality

The Bible is widely believed to place women in a subordinate role and condemn gay people. But does it really?

- 📕[Beth Allison Barr – *The Making of Biblical Womanhood: How the Subjugation of Women Became Gospel Truth*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54233271). "Biblical womanhood" is in reality not biblical, but a modern twist on the age-old ways of the world.
- 🎞️[For They Know Not What They Do](https://www.fortheyknow.org). Watch: [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08HQYQJLC), [Kanopy](https://www.kanopy.com/en/jeffco/video/10736369)
- 🎞️[Justin Lee - "Through My Eyes"](https://youtu.be/EVswuw3bJns). A short documentary interviewing young Christians who are gay.
- 📕[Andrew Marin – *Us versus Us: The Untold Story of Religion and the LGBT Community*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28084898). Did you know 86% of LGBT people were raised in church? And of the 54% that left, 76% are open to returning. (Compare that to the only 9% of ex-church-goers in the general U.S. population who are open to returning.) And lots of other surprises about a population that maybe you don't know as well as you thought you did.
- 📕[Ken Wilson - *A Letter to My Congregation: An Evangelical Pastor's Path to Embracing People Who Are Gay, Lesbian, Bisexual, and Transgender in the Company of Jesus*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20750953). The part addressing the biblical texts is especially helpful. The author's plea for a "third way" (full acceptance of all, modeled on Romans 14-15) is intriguing, if a little puzzling.
  - If you're not convinced that "homosexuality" in the Greco-Roman world was categorically different than what we call by that name, in that it was violent and exploitative, then read the third chapter of 📕[Sarah Ruden – Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in His Own Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7738312). Here's [a preview of the first few pages](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Paul_Among_the_People/ibjVCQAAQBAJ?gbpv=1&pg=PA45).
- 📕[Mark Wingfield – *Why Churches Need to Talk about Sexuality: Lessons Learned from Hard Conversations about Sex, Gender, Identity, and the Bible*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49053913). Provides insights into how a church community can stop avoiding the question.
- 📕[Kathy Baldock – *Walking the Bridgeless Canyon: Repairing the Breach Between the Church and the LGBT Community*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23367214). Delves deeper into history than most other books, answering questions like "Where did our modern idea of homosexuality come from?"
- 📕[James Brownson – *Bible, Gender, Sexuality: Reframing the Church's Debate on Same-Sex Relationships*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18912131). A deeper examination of the oft-cited biblical texts.
- 📕[Karen Keen – *Scripture, Ethics, and the Possibility of Same-Sex Relationships*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56880984). If you're still uncomfortable with turning from traditional interpretations, this book might be for you. It shows that biblical commands have always been interpreted and re-interpreted with discernment for human need, from within the Old Testament, to Jesus, to Paul, to the pastoral epistles, and finally throughout church history.

## Miscellaneous

- 🔊[Pete Enns & Jared Byas – *The Bible for Normal People* podcast](https://peteenns.com/podcast).
