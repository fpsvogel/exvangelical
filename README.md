# Exvangelical

Hi there! I was raised in a conservative Christian context. In recent years, in the process of becoming an adult and making sense of the world, I've realized that many of the old answers just don't work. So I'm growing and learning, using this space to save my favorite books and other resources.

- 🔊[Pete Enns & Jared Byas – *The Bible for Normal People* podcast](https://peteenns.com/podcast). Many episodes are a short exploration of a different approach to the Bible.

- 📕[Aaron Yilmaz – *Deliver Us From Evolution?: A Christian Biologist's In-Depth Look at the Evidence Reveals a Surprising Harmony Between Science and God*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/35225618). Written by a former young-earth creationist who addresses creationist arguments head-on.

- Alternate (shorter) starting point: 📕[Denis Lamoureux – *I Love Jesus & I Accept Evolution*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6553824) or 🌐[the free online course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/science-and-religion-101).
  - An even shorter starting point: 🎞️["What is the evidence for evolution?"](https://youtu.be/lIEoO5KdPvg)
- 📕[Robin Parry – *The Biblical Cosmos: A Pilgrim's Guide to the Weird and Wonderful World of the Bible*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/24853751). An investigation of how ancient Israelites viewed the world around them, which (spoiler alert) is very different from how we modern people see the world. The concluding chapters are fascinating, on how we modern people might fruitfully use this ancient view of the world.
- 🎞️[InspiringPhilosophy – videos about evolution and faith](https://inspiringphilosophy.org/evolution-and-genesis) and 🎞️["The Origins of Young Earth Creationism"](https://youtu.be/RLcNTAi0Cw4)
- 📕[John Walton – *The Lost World of Genesis One: Ancient Cosmology and the Origins Debate*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/8609131)
- 📄[Greg Boyd – "Evolution as Cosmic Warfare: A Biblical Perspective on Satan and 'Natural' Evil"](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Creation_Made_Free/gwpMAwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&pg=PA125). *(Most of the article is available on Google Books via that link. Whenever you see that the next page is unavailable, just write the next page number into the URL bar, e.g. "&pg=PA126", and press Enter.)* If you're wondering how evolution (a process necessarily involving death from the very beginning) fits with a perfect creator, here is one approach.
  - Along the way, Boyd also sketches an alternative theodicy in which evil does not come from God. It's a great antidote for those classic Christian conversation-enders, "God has a plan" and "God is in control". Oh thanks, it's so reassuring to know that *God* is the one behind the evil I'm suffering.
  - [Tolkien's creation account in the Silmarillion](https://archive.org/details/TheSilmarillionIllustratedJ.R.R.TolkienTedNasmith/page/n25/mode/2up?view=theater) beautifully tells a very similar theodicy.

## Women and gender roles

- 📕[Terran Williams – *How God Sees Women: The End of Patriarchy*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/60123774)

## LGBT inclusion

- 📕[Andrew Marin – *Us versus Us: The Untold Story of Religion and the LGBT Community*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/28084898). Did you know 86% of LGBT people were raised in church? And of the 54% that left, 76% are open to returning. (Compare that to the only 9% of ex-church-goers in the general U.S. population who are open to returning.)

  - If you're not convinced that "homosexuality" in the Greco-Roman world was categorically different than what we call by that name today, in that it was violent and exploitative, then read the third chapter of 📕[Sarah Ruden – Paul Among the People: The Apostle Reinterpreted and Reimagined in His Own Time](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7738312). Here's [a preview of the first few pages](https://www.google.com/books/edition/Paul_Among_the_People/ibjVCQAAQBAJ?gbpv=1&pg=PA45).
- 📕[Mark Wingfield – *Why Churches Need to Talk about Sexuality: Lessons Learned from Hard Conversations about Sex, Gender, Identity, and the Bible*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/49053913). The story of how one church stopped avoiding the question.
- 📕[Kathy Baldock – *Walking the Bridgeless Canyon: Repairing the Breach Between the Church and the LGBT Community*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23367214). Delves deeper into history than most other books, answering questions like "Where did our modern idea of homosexuality come from?"

- 📕[Karen Keen – *Scripture, Ethics, and the Possibility of Same-Sex Relationships*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/56880984). If you're still uncomfortable going against traditional interpretations, this book might be for you. It shows that biblical commands have *always* been interpreted and re-interpreted with discernment for human need. Old Testament writers did it, Jesus did it, Paul and the other epistle writers did it, and it's been done throughout church history.
- 📕[Katie Hays – *For The Bible Tells Me So: the biblical-theological necessity of LGBTQ+ inclusion in the church*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55984163). Short and sweet, a good review.

- 🎞️[*Eyes on the Prize: America's Civil Rights Movement*](https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/films/eyesontheprize). A must if you didn't learn much about the civil rights movement in school.
- 📕[Yaa Gyasi – *Homegoing*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27071490). The only novel in this entire list. Give it a try even if (like me) you're more into nonfiction.
- 📕[Michelle Alexander – *The New Jim Crow: Mass Incarceration in the Age of Colorblindness*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6792458). A depressing read but possibly the most important one on this list.
- 📕[Heather McGee – *The Sum of Us: What Racism Costs Everyone and How We Can Prosper Together*](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/53231851). Have you ever wondered why conservative whites oppose social programs that would benefit them more than anyone? It's the rich and powerful convince them that non-whites are getting unfair advantages (welfare queens, affirmative action), and that life is a zero-sum game where any benefit to (lazy) black and brown people comes at the expense of (hardworking) white people. Or to put it another way: no matter how bad the economic situation of whites, they can continue to feel like they're on top as long as black and brown people have it worse.
